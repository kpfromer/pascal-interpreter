# Pascal Interpreter

## Usage

This is a interpreter of the pascal language written in c++.

### Building the Binary

To do so you need to have [cmake](https://cmake.org/), a [c++ compiler (like clang, or gcc)](http://www.stroustrup.com/compilers.html).

Then create a folder called `build` in the root directory and run:
```
cmake ..
make
```

This will create the `PascalInterpreter` binary!

### Running the Binary

On unix based systems you can run the binary like so `./PascalInterpreter File.jack`
